    Class representing a vector data feature. 
    A feature object contains attributes/properties describing the feature, 
    equivalent to a row in a table, and a geometry describing its spatial representation. 
    
    Supports getting and setting feature properties/attributes via indexing, e.g. feat["name"] 
    gets or sets the feature's value for the name field. Raises an error if no such field name exists. 
    
    Supports the __geo_interface__ protocol, returning a GeoJSON feature object dictionary. 
    
    TODO: 
    - Change the geometry property, represented as a Geometry class instead of a pure GeoJSON dictinoary. 
    - Move all geometry calculations such as length, area, etc., to the geometry class. 
    
    Attributes:
        row: A list of values describing the feature properties as listed in the parent dataset's fields. 
        geometry: A GeoJSON dictionary describing the feature geometry, or None for features without geometry. 
        bbox: The bounding box of the feature, as a list of [xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax]. 
        _cached_bbox: A cached version of the feature's bounding box, to avoid having to repeat the calculation each time. 
            All methods that change the feature's geometry should reset this cache to None in order to recalculate the bbox. 
            In case of errors, the user may reset this themselves by setting it to None.

        geodetic_length: Returns the geodetic length of the feature geometry, expressed as km distance as calculated by the 
            vincenty algorithm.
