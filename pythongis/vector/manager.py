    Returns a new spatially joined dataset.

    Note: if the other dataset has fields with the same name as the main dataset, those will not be joined, keeping
        only the ones in the main dataset. 

    Arguments:
        data: The main VectorData dataset to be joined to.
        other: The other VectorData dataset to join to the main one.
        condition: The spatial condition required for joining a pair of features.
            Valid options include:
                - "distance" (along with "radius" and/or "n" args)
                - "intersects", "within", "contains", "crosses", "touches", "equals", "covers"
                - "disjoint"
        subkey (optional): If set, acts as an additional non-spatial condition. Only the pairs that pass this condition
            will be tested for the spatial condition. Specified as a function that takes a pair of features as its argument,
            and returns True if they should be joined.
        keepall (optional): If True, keeps all features in the main dataset regardless (default), otherwise only keeps the 
            ones that match.
        clip (optional): If the user is interested in the unique spatial relationship of each feature, the clip argument can
            be used to clip or alter the geometry of each joined pair. The default behavior is for each joined pair to get the
            geometry of the original left feature. 

            Valid values include "intersection", "difference", "union", or a function
            expecting two features and returning a GeoJSON dict or None, which will be performed on the joined geometries.

            The clip argument can also be used to ignore geometries alltogether, especially since joins
            with many matching pairs and duplicate geometries may lead to a large memory footprint. To reduce the memory footprint,
            the clip argument can be set to a function that returns None, returning a non-spatial table without geometries.
